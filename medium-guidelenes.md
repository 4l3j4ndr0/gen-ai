Do you want to write a publication?
You can do it! Please check these general rules to consider when writing an article.

The article must be created first on Google Docs, and shared to the editorial team at cloudops-medium@globant.com with editor permissions. Medium is a very limited platform for peer reviewing, Google Docs is more suited for that. When the time comes, the editor reviewing your article will ask you to move it to Medium.

We value the creation of high quality content, and therefore the topic chosen is critical. Chose a topic that will add value to the audience and other globers.

Create a narrative that is easy to follow for everyone. You may want to add the following sections:

Header Image.

Introduction / Background

Prerequisites

Main Section

Conclusion

References

Review the story to ensure it is well-written and without errors (typos, spelling, redundancy, etc.)

Add a catchy title (6 to 12 words works best!)

Add a few lines introduction to explain to the reader what is the article about

Add the sources and references

Add links to the sample code in a repository

Add format to help the reader identify the most relevant elements

Add images or screenshots to help the reader understand the content

Do not write titles in uppercase

Do not "borrow" or plagiarize any other content

Do not include any private or sensitive information (like passwords, tokens, accounts names, etc.)

The article length should be between 5 and 12 minutes, if it is longer than that, it should be split into two (or more) parts.
